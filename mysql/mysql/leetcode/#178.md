Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

| Score | Rank |
| ------ | ----- |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |


#### Approach #1 Brute Force [Time Limit Exceeded]

**Intuition**

Check all the substring one by one to see if it has no duplicate character.

**Algorithm**

Suppose we have a function `boolean allUnique(String substring)` ....

**mysql**

```mysql
SELECT
    Id,
    Score,
    FIND_IN_SET(
        cast(Score AS CHAR(10)),
        Sec.distinctCharScoreSet
    ) AS rank
FROM
    Scores,
    (
        SELECT
            GROUP_CONCAT(distinctCharScore) AS distinctCharScoreSet
        FROM
            (
                SELECT DISTINCT
                    cast(Score AS CHAR(10)) AS distinctCharScore,
                    1 AS tempColumn
                FROM
                    Scores
                GROUP BY
                    distinctCharScore
                ORDER BY
                    distinctCharScore DESC
            ) AS Fir
        GROUP BY
            tempColumn
    ) AS Sec
ORDER BY
    rank ASC
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(n^3)$$.

To verify if characters within index range $$[i, j)$$ are all unique, we need to scan all of them. Thus, it costs $$O(j - i)$$ time.

For a given `i`, the sum of time costed by each $$j \in [i+1, n]$$ is

$$
\sum_{i+1}^{n}O(j - i)
$$

Thus, the sum of all the time consumption is:

$$
O\left(\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\left(\sum_{j = i + 1}^{n}(j - i)\right)\right) =
O\left(\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\frac{(1 + n - i)(n - i)}{2}\right) =
O(n^3)
$$

* Space complexity : $$O(min(n, m))$$. We need $$O(k)$$ space for checking a substring has no duplicate characters, where $$k$$ is the size of the `Set`. The size of the Set is upper bounded by the size of the string $$n$$ and the size of the charset/alphabet $$m$$.
